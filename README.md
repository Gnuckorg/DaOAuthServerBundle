DaOAuthServerBundle
===================

This bundle for Symfony2 (built upon [FOSOAuthServerBundle](https://github.com/FriendsOfSymfony/FOSOAuthServerBundle)) allows to use the oauth mechanism in different "authspaces". It gives the possibility to build a unique SSO oauth server acting as if you had several ones.
